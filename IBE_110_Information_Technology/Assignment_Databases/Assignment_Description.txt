Use what we have learned about databases.

Create a database of your choice. The topic can be what you want.
Make at least 3 tables and use constraints.
Insert values to the tables.
Create queries against the tables.

I decided to make a simple retail store database
(which is not at all suitable for production
but rather a showcase of how parts of the database might be desigend).


I did make a rather dum mistake throughout this assignment naming the
database IBE151 (which was another course I took at the same time).
And I realised after delivery.

Oh well.
