  Cargo
    the build system and package manager
    ..building your code, downloading the libraries (dependencies) your code depends on

    expects your source files to live inside the src directory

    create and run a new project
      $ cargo new <project_name>
      $ cd <project_name>
      $ cargo build # creates an executable file in ./target/debug/<project_name>
      alternativley we can build and run with
        $ cargo run

    Crates
      packages of code are referred to as crates

    Cargo.lock
      Keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project.
      Wonâ€™t ever need to change this file manually.
      Cargo manages its contents for you.
